  <b> How does our project work? </h>
  - The user runs our program 
  - The program activates the camera and either captures a single picture or a live feed of the user's face (input is given frame by frame).
  - The frame is then analyzed by the haarcascades.xml file
  - The frame is then sent to the eye_tree_eyeglasses.xml or the frontalcatface.xml file which will draw a rectangle/circle or other fancy denotations
  - The output frame is then sent back and displayed to the user 
  
  
  There can be additional features like face-counter, name-tags, etc..
